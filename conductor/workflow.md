# Project Workflow

## Guiding Principles

1.  **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in `plan.md`
2.  **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be
    documented in `tech-stack.md` *before* implementation
3.  **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing
    functionality
4.  **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules
5.  **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
6.  **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use
    `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (tests, linters) to ensure single execution.

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1.  **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from `plan.md` in sequential
    order

2.  **Mark In Progress:** Before beginning work, edit `plan.md` and change the
    task from `[ ]` to `[~]`

3.  **Write Failing Tests (Red Phase):**

    -   Create a new test file for the feature or bug fix.
    -   Write one or more unit tests that clearly define the expected behavior
        and acceptance criteria for the task.
    -   **CRITICAL:** Run the tests and confirm that they fail as expected. This
        is the "Red" phase of TDD. Do not proceed until you have failing tests.

4.  **Implement to Pass Tests (Green Phase):**

    -   Write the minimum amount of application code necessary to make the
        failing tests pass.
    -   Run the test suite again and confirm that all tests now pass. This is
        the "Green" phase.

5.  **Refactor (Optional but Recommended):**

    -   With the safety of passing tests, refactor the implementation code and
        the test code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and enhance
        performance without changing the external behavior.
    -   Rerun tests to ensure they still pass after refactoring.

6.  **Verify Coverage:** Run coverage reports using the project's chosen tools.
    For example, in a Python project, this might look like: `pytest --cov=carebridge --cov-report=term` Target: >80% coverage for new code.

7.  **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:

    -   **STOP** implementation
    -   Update `tech-stack.md` with new design
    -   Add dated note explaining the change
    -   Resume implementation

8.  **Commit Code Changes:**

    -   Stage all code changes related to the task.
    -   Propose a clear, concise commit message e.g, `feat(analyzer): Implement core clinical log extraction`.
    -   Perform the commit.

9.  **Attach Task Summary with Git Notes:**

    -   **Step 9.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-completed commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
    -   **Step 9.2: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed summary for the completed task.
    -   **Step 9.3: Attach Note:** Use `git notes add -m "<note content>" <commit_hash>`.

10. **Get and Record Task Commit SHA:**

    -   **Step 10.1: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the line for the completed task, update its status from `[~]` to `[x]`, and append the first 7 characters of the commit hash.
    -   **Step 10.2: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

11. **Commit Plan Update:**

    -   Stage and commit `plan.md` with message `conductor(plan): Mark task '...' as complete`.

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete, verify:

-   [ ] All tests pass
-   [ ] Code coverage meets requirements (>80%)
-   [ ] Code follows project's code style guidelines (`conductor/code_styleguides/`)
-   [ ] All public functions/methods are documented
-   [ ] Type safety is enforced
-   [ ] No linting or static analysis errors
-   [ ] Works correctly on mobile layout
-   [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced

## Development Commands

### Python Core (carebridge/)
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s carebridge/tests -p "test_*.py"
```

### Go Backend (backend/)
```bash
cd backend && go test ./... && cd ..
```
